<h1>Watching some YAPC::EU 2010 presentations</h1>

<p>In August, Perl mongers gathered in Pisa for the annual
<a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/">YAPC::EU</a>, one of the
biggest Perl meetings. I couldn&#8217;t make it there, but at least I
finally got to check out the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/yapceu2010">presentation recordings</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the recordings are pretty bad, for the most part. The
speakers are hard or impossible to hear, and worse, the slides are
unreadable. For technical presentations with code, that&#8217;s a
dealbreaker. I know one doesn&#8217;t complain about volunteer efforts,
especially when one cannot make a reasonable suggestion for
improvement. So all I want to say is that it would be great if the
organizers of next years YAPC::EU could improve on that.</p>

<p>But then, it just means I gotta go myself next time. It&#8217;s a community
event, after all.</p>

<p>Anyway, I still made some notes on what I saw. Here are the
interesting bits.</p>

<p>Leon Timmerman presented
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKo4PUKuZ8I"><em>An alternative to XS</em></a>. He
said that while XS is flexible and mature, it&#8217;s yet another new
language to learn and it&#8217;s not trivial. Instead, Leon is working on
using C++ templates to do the same job. Let&#8217;s see how that works out.</p>

<p>Dave Rolsky showed off
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/yapceu2010#g/c/6546F3721A196286"><em>Fey and Fey::ORM</em></a>. It&#8217;s
too bad I couldn&#8217;t really follow his talk nor see any of the slides,
because I&#8217;m having a really hard time with the ORMs I&#8217;ve seen and I
was wondering if I&#8217;m just too dumb. In his introduction Dave says that
the same happened to him, so he wrote Fey as a different kind of
ORM. I might be grossly misrepresenting, from memory, what he actually
said. I will keep Fey on the radar.</p>

<p>Aaron Crane&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/yapceu2010#grid/user/348D7F53EB2BBDCA"><em>Perl on Speed: Multicore Programming for Mortals</em></a>
has clear audio, but no slides. Aaron prefers processes over
threads. It&#8217;s easier, the OS does advanced scheduling for you, and not
having shared memory forces you to write a clear architecture with
data being passed at clear boundaries. Processes are cheap on Linux
anyway. However, I wonder to what extent that preference for processes
is due to
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlthrtut.html#Performance-considerations">Perl&#8217;s less-than-optimal thread implementation</a>. Erlang
processes are super cheap and work great into the thousands, per core.</p>

<p>SawyerX presented
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/yapceu2010#g/c/6C2680AF9864471D"><em>When Perl Met Android</em></a>,
which I found really interesting. I didn&#8217;t know about SL4A, the
Scripting Layer for Android. It runs an RPC server that speaks JSON,
so different languages can easily interface with it. I only watched
the first half of Sawyer&#8217;s talk as the second half consists of code
samples that you can&#8217;t see in the recording. But it was good to learn
that Android.pm supports almost all of the Android API: dialogs,
sensors, GPS, text-to-speech, etc. It also supports daemons. Someone
got Plack to run&#8212;-local web apps!</p>

<p>And the price for the funniest announcement goes to Dave Cross for
Perl Vogue. &#8220;Is Plack the new Black?&#8221; Dave
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykc4p6CeCuY">announced</a>
<a href="http://www.perlvogue.com">www.perlvogue.com</a>, where Perl fashionistas
check out the latest trends.</p>

<p>Wow, amazing how many presentations you can watch when you stop two
minutes in for most of them :-)</p>
