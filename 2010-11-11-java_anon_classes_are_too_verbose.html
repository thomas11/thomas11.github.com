<p>Java doesn&#8217;t have first-class functions or closures, but you can
emulate some of that with anonymous classes. Alas, they are just too
cumbersome and verbose&#8212;it&#8217;s not elegant anymore if you need more LoC
than with the iterative loop.</p>

<p>Recently at work, I wanted to execute some code for each member of a
List, and I needed to know which iteration step I was at. A
straightforward solution is, obviously, the classic for loop:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; keyword.getSynonyms(); i++) {
    String synonym = keyword.getSynonyms().get(i);
    // do something
}</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s fine in many cases, but it has two problems. The extra line to
get at the List element is annoying. More importantly, depending on
the List implementation the <code>get(i)</code> operation might be in O(n),
requiring another scan of the list each time.</p>

<p>So we could iterate normally and count ourselves:</p>

<pre><code>int order = 0;
for (String synonym : keyword.getSynonyms()) {
    // do something
    order++;
}</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s better, but I needed several such loops, and I wondered if I
couldn&#8217;t write all that plumbing just once. I came up with this:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Counting&lt;T, E extends Throwable&gt;
{        
    public void loop(Iterable&lt;T&gt; things) throws E
    {
        int step = 0;
        for (T t : things)
        {
            iteration(t, step);
            step++;
        }
    }

    public abstract void iteration(T thing, int step) throws E;
}</code></pre>

<p>As the loop body can throw exceptions, and we might want to declare
the specific kind of exception, this needs to be an additional generic
type. This breaks if you need more than one exception type.</p>

<p>The above loop then becomes</p>

<pre><code>new Counting&lt;String, SQLException&gt;()
{
    @Override public void iteration(String synonym, int step)
    throws SQLException
    {
        // do something
    }
}.loop( keyword.getSynonyms() );</code></pre>

<p>Hmmm. Even after writing an abstract class to extract the repeated
parts, and not counting my preference for opening-brace-on-new-line, I
still haven&#8217;t saved a single line. Can I have <code>map</code> and first-class
functions, please? Time for Scala?</p>
