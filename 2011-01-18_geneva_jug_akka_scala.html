<p>The <a href="">Geneva Java User&#8217;s Group</a> had their annual New Year&#8217;s meeting
yesterday, with two invited speakers. Iulian Dragos gave an Intro to
Scala, and Jonas Bonér presented his actor library
<a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a>.</p>

<p>Iulian works on Scala and with Scala with Martin Odersky at EPFL
Lausanne and Odersky&#8217;s consulting company Scala Solutions. For initial
motivation, he listed some companies already using Scala in
production. Apart from the ones known in the anglophone hacker web
like Twitter and Foursquare, some big European enterprises such as
Credit Suisse, UBS, and Siemens were on the list. Iulian&#8217;s
presentation was then a straightforward intro to Scala. Up to slide
13, I noted, it was all Perl in a different syntax :-) He then moved
on to more advanced features such as mix-ins. Their sensitivity to the
order in which they are included left the audience sceptical. The
parallel collections of the upcoming Scala 2.9, on the other hand,
looked great.</p>

<p>Overall a nice intro to Scala. It suffered a bit from lack of
practical examples for the advanced language features, but that&#8217;s
unavoidable given the time constraints. Speaker&#8217;s note: a laser
pointer would have been very helpful for going through sample code.</p>

<p><a href="http://jonasboner.com">Jonas Bonér</a> is the principal author of Akka,
a very powerful actor framework written in Scala. Jonas uses Scala
since 2005. He loves Erlang and only moved on to the JVM world because
he had difficulties convincing others of its greatness. The natural
compromise was then to implement an Erlang-style platform using Scala
actors, which became Akka.</p>

<p>Akka is very optimized. An actor uses only 600 bytes (yes, bytes) of
memory, so you can spawn millions of them. Syntax is easy and
flexible: send a message to an actor with a single bang (<code>!</code>), <code>!!</code>
blocks, <code>!!!</code> returns a <code>Future</code>.</p>

<p>A unique property of Akka is that it combines actors with Software
Transactional Memory, usually regarded as two separate ideas to tackle
concurrency. You write</p>

<pre><code>import akka.stm. ...

atomic {
    atomic {
        // Atomic blocks are composable, so they don't break
        // encapsulation like locks.
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>If you, for instance, send a message to an actor a1, which updates its
state atomically, messages another actor a2, which then also tries to
updates its state atomically but fails, then the whole chain will be
rolled back and retried, even if the messaging was
asynchronous. Powerful indeed.</p>

<p>Jonas presented a fascinating integration example towards the end of
this talk. He likes the Apache Camel integration framework. Akka comes
with a Camel module. One can define an actor with, for example,
<code>endpoint "file://foo"</code>. Any change to <code>foo</code> will then be send as a
message to the actor. The other way round works, too, of course&#8212;think
websockets.</p>

<p>Almost as an aside, Jonas mentioned that Akka supports code hot-swap
like Erlang.</p>

<p>Akka looks like a very powerful framework indeed, to be investigated.</p>

<p>Jonas presented in a great, buddy-like way, like a fellow hacker
chatting over a beer. Some ranting and rambling only added to the
impact of the presentation. His slides were minimal and well
done&#8212;great talk overall.</p>
