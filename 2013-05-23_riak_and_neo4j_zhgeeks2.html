    <span class="date">May 23, 2013</span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; 
  
  <span itemprop="description">We had two great zhgeeks meetups recently: Sean Cribbs spoke about Riak and eventual consistency, and Jim Webber presented Neo4j. Sean&#39;s talk was also an intro to distributed systems with a list of foundational papers that I list in this post.</span>
  
</div>

<div class="article" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>This past April we at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/zhgeeks/">zhgeeks</a> had
the opportunity to host two great database-centric meetups.</p>

<p>As an aside, I can now say &ldquo;we&rdquo; because <a href="Muharem
Hrnjadovic">Muharem Hrnjadovic</a>, founder and organizer of zhgeeks, added me as a
co-organizer. Make no mistake, I didn&rsquo;t do much so far and all credit
for zhgeeks goes to Muharem. I will get more involved in organizing
future meetups, though. We have a couple of good ideas, by the way, so
stay tuned!</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://jimwebber.org/">Jim Webber</a>, Chief Scientist at
<a href="http://www.neotechnology.com/">Neo Technology</a>, presented
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/zhgeeks/events/97436192/">Neo4j and connected data</a>.
This was a relatively high-level talk where Jim spent the first half
or so on pointing out use cases for graph databases and the problem
domains for which they are best suited&mdash;not surprisingly, domains
with highly interconnected data. Later on Jim showed Neo4J&rsquo;s new query
language Cypher, which is a very expressive textual query language for
graphs.</p>

<p><img src="/static/posts/jim webber zhgeeks.jpg" /></p>

<p>Jim&rsquo;s a great speaker with lots of wit and plenty of humorous slides.
The audience&mdash;one of the largest we had so far at zhgeeks&mdash;was
captured.</p>

<p>After Jim&rsquo;s presentation we had a brief talk by Florian MÃ¼ller,
co-founder of <a href="http://jooik.com/">jooik</a>, about how they use Neo4j in
their startup. It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to hear of that kind of
real-world experience.</p>

<p>Later in April we had <a href="http://seancribbs.com/">Sean Cribbs</a> from
<a href="http://basho.com/">Basho</a>, makers of the
<a href="http://basho.com/riak/">Riak</a> distributed database, presenting
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/zhgeeks/events/107680222/">Understanding Eventual Consistency and Riak</a>.
This was again an awesome talk. Sean wasn&rsquo;t afraid to go into some
technical details of distributed systems which I appreciated very
much. He structured the talk as a tour of some of the most influential
papers in distributed systems, pointing out how Riak implements each
technique and deals with the trade-offs involved. I found this to be a
great overview of the field, so I made a list of the papers and
resources Sean mentioned.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sean recommends the
<a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/">Paper Trail</a> blog by Henry
Robinson that has great write-ups on important topics in
distributed systems.</li>
<li>Fischer, Lynn, Patterson 1985:
<a href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/arvind/cs425/doc/fischer.pdf">Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process (pdf)</a>
introduces the &ldquo;FLP impossiblity&rdquo;: in an asynchronous setting
there is no distributed algorithm that solves the consensus
problem of several nodes agreeing on a common value. Paper Trail
has a
<a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/">good post</a>
on this paper.</li>
<li>Fox, Brewer 1999:
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.3690&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Harvest, yield, and scalable tolerant systems (pdf)</a>
focuses on what kind of compromises a distributed system can make
in case of node failures or partitions. Yield is the probability
of completing a request and harvest is a measure of the accuracy
of the response, defined as the fraction of the existing data the
system used to come up with the response. Coda Hale wrote a great
<a href="http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/">overview article on Harvest, yield and the CAP theorem</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, Sean touched on Leslie Lamport&rsquo;s work on safety and
liveness of distributed systems in his 1977 paper
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.137.9454">Proving the Correctness of Multiprocess Programs</a>.
Sean did a great job of relating Lamport&rsquo;s results to currently
existing algorithms and systems. The basic question is, if you
have F failures, how many nodes that are still up do you need to
respond? If you need F + 1 (at least one), it is an eventually
consistent system. A majority of nodes, 2F + 1, corresponds to
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#paxos-simple">Paxos</a>
and two-phase-commit. A super majority, 3F + 1, is called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">Byzantine fault tolerance</a>.</li>
<li>Riak itself is heavily based on the
<a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Amazon dynamo paper (pdf)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, Sean recommended the talk
<a href="http://vimeo.com/52414903">data structures in Riak</a>.</p>

<p>A question from the audience was what other solutions in the
bewildering space of distributed systems and databases were similar to
Riak. Among the open source ones Sean thought
<a href="http://www.project-voldemort.com/voldemort/">Voldemort</a> to be the
closest, followed by <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>.</p>
