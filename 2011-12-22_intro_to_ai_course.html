  <span itemprop="description">The online class was a bold experiment, bringing Stanford teaching by Sebastian Thun and Peter Norvig to over 100,000 students. I loved the experience and got a lot out of it. Here are some thoughts and selected notes.</span>
</div>

<div class="article" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>I had always been interested in AI but ended up choosing different
majors in college. Naturally, this
<a href="https://www.ai-class.com/">online AI class</a> couldn&rsquo;t make up for that
by itself given the time constraints, but I feel it did a great job on
bringing the students up to speed in the important basics of the
field. The range of topics was wide enough to serve as a solid
foundation for further reading:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to think of environments</li>
<li>Searching through state spaces, A* search</li>
<li>Probability and Bayes Rule</li>
<li>Bayes Networks, D-Separation and probabilistic inference</li>
<li>Sampling methods</li>
<li>Machine Learning basics and k-nearest neighbors</li>
<li>Planning under uncertainty, Markov Decision Processes
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>The online format worked great. I enjoyed the little quizzes during
the course of each lecture because they made me pay more attention and
helped retention.</p>

<p>Due to work and other constraints I couldn&rsquo;t give the class as much
time as I wanted, but I still finished with a score of 88%. Nothing
special given that I have a CS degree, but not too bad either. In any
case I&rsquo;m proud that I took the time to sit down every week and do
this, and of having been part of this huge experiment that will
probably shape the future of learning.</p>

<p>Below are some of my class notes. They are not complete and you&rsquo;d be
better off taking the class yourself---it&rsquo;s

<h2>1 Welcome to AI</h2>

<p>AI in a nutshell: an agent observes its environments through sensors,
and can influence it through actuators. The <em>control plan</em> mapping
sensor input to activator output is the focus of AI. The repeated
cycle of input and output is the <em>Perception Action Cycle</em>.</p>

<p>Classifying environments:</p>

<ul>
<li>An environment is <em>fully observable</em> if an agent can, at all
times, make all observations to make the optimal choice, i.e., see
the entire state of the environment (chess). If this is not
possible and the agent has to memorize previous observations
(poker), it is <em>partially observable</em>.</li>
<li>It can be deterministic (chess) or stochastic (dice games).</li>
<li>The agent&rsquo;s actuators can be discrete or continuous (e.g. throwing
darts: infinite possibilities of angles and acceleration).</li>
<li>It can be benign or adversarial.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Problem Solving</h2>

<p>Definition of a problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>initial state</li>
<li>actions(s) = {a1, a2, &hellip;}</li>
<li>result(s, a) = s&rsquo;</li>
<li>goaltest(s) = T|F</li>
<li>pathcost(s-a-&gt;s-a-&gt;s-&hellip;) -&gt; n</li>
<li>stepcost(s, a, s&rsquo;) -&gt; n</li>
</ul>

<p><em>State space</em> = explored + frontier + unexplored</p>

<p><em>Tree search</em>: until the goal is reached, take a choice from the
frontier and apply all actions to it. This is a whole family of
algorithms, since the removal of the choice is critical.</p>

<p>In breadth-first tree search, the three sections of the state space
correspond to three vertical regions of the tree.</p>

<p>Tree search backtracks, since for each tree node, the one we came from
is just another frontier node.</p>

<p>We can turn the tree search into a graph search by remembering which
nodes we&rsquo;ve seen already.</p>

<p>In <em>uniform cost search</em> we pick the cheapest choice first.</p>

<p>For finding the goal in the shortest route as in hops, breadth-first
is optimal while depth-first is not. For finding the goal via the
cheapest route, uniform cost is optimal.</p>

<p>Uniform cost search is related to topological maps: we fan out from a
starting point, in circles of increasing distance from the starting
point.</p>

<h3>A* search</h3>

<p><code>f = g + h</code> where g(p) is the path cost and h(p) = h(final state of p)
is the estimated distance to the goal.</p>

<p>A* search does not end when the goal is reached---there might be
other, shorter paths. The goal test happens after selecting the next
path to be taken off the frontier.</p>

<p>A* finds the lowest cost path if, for all s, h(s) &lt;= true cost. In
other words, h is <em>optimistic</em> or <em>admissible</em>, it never overestimates.</p>

<p>Problem solving works when:</p>

<ul>
<li>the domain is fully observable,</li>
<li>the domain is known (available actions),</li>
<li>the domain is discrete (finite number of actions),</li>
<li>the domain is deterministic, and</li>
<li>the domain is static.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the implementation of paths and state spaces the core data
structure is the <em>node</em>, with four fields: state, action (it took to
get there), cost (total), parent (preceding state). A linked list of
nodes represents a path. The two main data structures dealing with
nodes are the frontier and the explored list. The frontier is a
priority queue with an additional set for membership test. The
explored list can be a simple set.</p>

<h2>3 Probability in AI</h2>

<p><em>Bayes Networks</em>: nodes are random variables. Edges signify
probabilistic influence. It&rsquo;s a compact representation of a
probability distribution over a very large joint distribution of all
involved variables. The state space has the size 2^n even if the
variables were all binary.</p>

<p>If X and Y are independent, <code>P(X,Y) = P(X)*P(Y)</code>. The P(X) and P(Y)
are called <em>marginals</em>.</p>

<p>First, some simple probability review:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total probability: <code>P(Y) = P(Y|X=i)*P(X=i)</code> summed over all i.</li>
<li>Negation: <code>P(-X|Y) = 1 - P(X|Y)</code>.</li>
<li>Joint probabilities: <code>P(X,Y) = P(Y=y|X=x) * P(X=x)</code> and vice
versa.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bayes Rule</h3>

<p><code>P(A|B) = P(B|A)\*P(A) / P(B)</code>. In this formula, P(B|A) is the
<em>likelihood</em>, P(A) the <em>prior</em>, P(B) the <em>marginal likelihood</em>, and
P(A|B) the <em>posterior</em>. The marginal likelihood can be replaced by the
total probability.</p>

<p>Drawing Bayes Rule with two nodes A and B is a Bayesian network with
two nodes A-&gt;B!</p>

<p>How many parameters do we need to specify a Bayes Network of two
variables? Three: P(A) (from which we derive P(-A)), P(B|A), and
P(B|-A).</p>

<p>Observe that using Bayes Rule, the normalizer is the same for both
P(A|B) and P(-A|B). The two cases sum to 1. So we can compute Bayes
Rule in a different way, effectively ignoring the normalizer:</p>

<pre><code>P'(A|B)  = P(B|A)  P(A)
P'(-A|B) = P(B|-A) P(-A)

P(A|B)  = &lt;eta&gt;P'(A|B)
P(-A|B) = &lt;eta&gt;P'(-A|B)

&lt;eta&gt; = 1 / (P'(A|B) + P'(-A|B))
</code></pre>

<p>We defer the calculation of the normalizer.</p>

<p>Exploiting <em>conditional independence</em>: if T1 and T2 with values x and
y depend on A, what is P(t1|t2), given P(A), P(x|A) and P(y|A)? Using
total probability, it is <code>P(t2|t1,A) * P(A|t1) + P(t2|t1,-A) *
P(-A|t1)</code>. But if we know A and T1 and T2 are independent, knowledge
of the first test gives me no more information about the second test.
So we can simplify this to <code>P(t2|A)P(A|t1) + P(t2|-A)P(-A|t1)</code>.</p>

<p>Absolute independence does not imply conditional independence, and
vice versa.</p>

<p><em>Confounding causes</em>: two (unobservable) nodes influence one output
variable. There&rsquo;s no connection between the two influencing
variables---if P(A) = x, then P(A|B=b) = x.</p>

<p><em>Explaining away</em>: independence does not imply conditional
 independence. If we have</p>

<pre><code>S   R
 \ /
  H
</code></pre>

<p>then S and R are independent. But if we observe H, they are not
independent anymore---its value gives us a clue which one is more
likely.</p>

<h2>Bayes Networks</h2>

<p>The joint probability of a BN is the product of the probabilities of
its nodes, conditioned on their incoming arcs.</p>

<p>How many parameters define a BN? If the above product is <code>P(A) P(B)
P(C|A,B) P(D|C) P(E|C)</code>, it&rsquo;s ten. P(A) and P(B) are one each. P(D|C)
and P(E|C) are two each, for each possible value of C. P(C|A,B) is 4:
all combinations of A and B.</p>

<h3>D-Separation</h3>

<p>This is about <em>conditional independence</em> in BNs, also called
<em>reachability</em>.</p>

<p>To determine independence of variables in a graph (like a BN), think
about &ldquo;would knowing X help me to know more about Y?&rdquo; More formally,
variables are dependent if they are connected by a path of <em>unknown</em>
variables.</p>

<p><code>A -&gt; UNKNOWN -&gt; B</code> is an <em>active triplet</em>, <code>A -&gt; KNOWN -&gt; B</code> is
<em>inactive</em>.</p>

<p>This also goes for upstream relations---this is the &ldquo;explaining away&rdquo;
case.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bnintro.html">Bayes Ball</a> for
an easy test of conditional independence in BNs.</p>

<h2>4 Probabilistic Inference</h2>

<p>Given a BN, we can ask &ldquo;for these inputs, what are the outputs?&rdquo; We
call the input <em>evidence</em>, the output <em>query</em>, and the interior nodes
<em>hidden variables</em>. The answer is a complete probability distribution
over the query variables, called the <em>posterior distribution</em>: P(Q1,
Q2, &hellip;|E1=e1, &hellip;).</p>

<p>Evidence nodes whose value we don&rsquo;t know, and query nodes we don&rsquo;t
care about are hidden!</p>

<p>The obvious question is which evidence has the most likely result,
i.e., the argmax over the above P(&hellip;).</p>

<h3>Enumeration</h3>

<p><em>Conditional probability</em>: <code>P(Q|E) = P(Q,E) / P(E)</code>.</p>

<p>Enumerating a BN, here for the burglary/earthquake -&gt; alarm -&gt;
John/Mary calls network. We sum over the probability product for all
combinations of the hidden variables (&ldquo;Se&rdquo; = sum over e).</p>

<pre><code>Se(Sa( P(+b) P(e) P(A|+b,e)P(+j|a)P(+m,a) ))
</code></pre>

<p>Moving invariants out of inner loops:</p>

<pre><code>P(+b) S( P(e) S(P(A|+b,e)P(+j|a)P(+m,a)) )
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s still not good enough. The next step is to <em>maximize
independence</em>.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;linear&rdquo; BN where each node points to one other node will take O(n),
while one where each node is connected to all other nodes will take
(2^n).</p>

<p>The next optimization is <em>variable elimination</em> (4.8). First, joining
factors. Let&rsquo;s say we have P&reg; and P(T|R). We combine them into
P(R,T) by multiplying their tables together, through all combinations
of r and t. Then, elimination (also called marginalization): turn
P(R,T) into P(T) by summing up the P(R,T) table over r.</p>

<h2>Approximate Inference Sampling</h2>

<p>Flip coin repeatedly, count outcomes to estimate the joint probability
distribution. In a BN</p>

<p>If the count of each sampled variable is chosen according to the probability
tables, the sampling approaches the true probability distribution with
infinite samples, then the sampling method is <em>consistent</em>.</p>

<p><em>Rejection sampling</em>: to estimate the distribution for a conditional
variable, we go through the samples and reject all those that don&rsquo;t
match the condition (evidence). The problem is that if the evidence is
unlikely we need to reject most samples.</p>

<p><em>Likelihood weighting</em> fixes this problem. We fix the evidence
variables and sample the rest, so we can keep all samples. However,
the distribution is inconsistent. To make it consistent, we attach a
probabilistic weight to each sample. For instance, if rain has a
probability of 0.4 and we&rsquo;re sampling P(grass wet|rain), we are forced
to choose the 0.4 probability entry for rain in its table, so we
weight the sample with 0.4.</p>

<p><em>Gibb&rsquo;s Sampling</em> takes all evidence into account. It&rsquo;s based on
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The idea is to sample one variable at
a time, conditioned on all the others. We initialize all variables for
the first sample. In each following iteration, we choose one variable
at random and resample it. So we randomly walk the space of variable
assignments. Even though each iteration depends on the previous one,
the method is consistent.</p>

<h2>5 Machine Learning</h2>

<p><em>Machine learning</em> is learning models from data. (Later note: it&rsquo;s
interesting to compare this definition with Andrew Ng&rsquo;s from the
Stanford Machine Learning class on coursera: giving computers the
ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.)</p>

<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>

<p>Given a <em>feature vector</em> <code>x1, ..., xn -&gt; y</code>, y is the <em>target label</em> or
<em>predictor</em>. A set of feature vectors with their target labels is
called the data.</p>

<p><em>Occam&rsquo;s Razor</em>: prefer the simpler hypothesis. There is a conflict
between generalization error and training data error. Minimizing the
latter leads to overfitting.</p>

<p><em>Maximum Likelihood</em>: given a number of discrete data points y_i, find
the P(x) that maximizes the likelihood of x in the data. With two
discrete outcomes H and S: <code>p(S) = q</code>, <code>p(y_i) = q</code> if y_i=S, 1-q
otherwise. Then <code>p(data) = multover(p(y_i) = q^(count(y_i=H) *
(1-q)^(count(Y_i=S))</code>.</p>

<p>We can do the counts, now we have to determine q. Maximizing p(data)
is equivalent to maximizing log(p(data)).</p>

<p>We can construct a BN modeling the problem. If we have a dictionary
with 12 words, the BN will have 23 parameters: 1 for P(spam), and 12
each for the spam and ham distributions. The parameters are estimated
by supervised learning using an ML estimator with training data.</p>

<p>To determine whether a message is spam, given the prior P(S), we
multiply the prior with the probabilities of each word of occuring in
a spam message, and divide by this expression plus the equivalent one
for ham (total probability). Normal Bayes Theorem.</p>

<p>When determing the p(w) that a word is spam by counting its occurences
in the test data spam, we risk overfitting. When a word does not occur
in the test data, the P(S) of a message containing that word will
always be 0.</p>

<p><em>Laplace smoothing</em> addresses this. Instead of p(x) = count(x)/N, we
add a smoothing factor: <code>p(x) = count(x)+k / count(x) + N</code>, where N is
the number of total different values.</p>

<p>Cross-validation: find the Laplacian k by cross-validating repeatedly.</p>

<p>Supervised learning can be classification (what we&rsquo;ve done until now),
and regression: make continuous predictions, such as for tomorrow&rsquo;s
temperature.</p>

<p>Suggestively: what&rsquo;s the best curve through the data points? The one
that hits each point would be good, but it&rsquo;s overfit of course.</p>

<p>Linear regression formally: Given x11, &hellip;, x1n -&gt; y1 to xm1, &hellip;, xmn
-&gt; ym, we want f(x) = y. In two dimensions: f(x) = w1*x + w0.</p>

<p>We minimize the loss function modeling the residual error.</p>

<ul>
<li>LOSS = sum_j(yj - w1*xj - w0)^2.</li>
<li>w1* = argmin_w(L)
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Because we minimize quadratic error, outliers penalize
disproportionately.</p>

<p>Logistic regression: if f(x) is a linear regression, z = 1 / 1 +
e^(-f(x)).</p>

<p>Gradient descent: iterative method. The i+1 guess is the ith guess
minus its gradient times a small alpha (0.01). Gradient descent gets
trapped in local minima.</p>

<p>Which linear separator (if there is one) is preferrable? The one that
maximizes the margin, i.e., the distance to the closer data
points. This ensures that future real data will probably be on the
right side. SVMs and Boosting are popular to find this separator.</p>

<p>SVMs work with kernels to enable linear separation. For instance, if
points are circular around the origin, and class + is closer than
class -, there is no linear separator. But if we map the points to
their distance from origin, there is.</p>

<p>So far, all methods of supervised learning were parametric. The number
of parameters was independent of the data.</p>

<p>In non-parametric methods, the number of params can grow over time.</p>

<p><em>Conformate</em> plans are plans that are guaranteed to reach a goal
without sensing the world.</p>

<h2>9 Planning under uncertainty</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve covered planning, uncertainty, and learning before, but not in
combination. Where planning and uncertainty intersect, we will look at
<em>(Partially observable) Markov Decision Processes</em> (MDPs). In
combination with learning, we&rsquo;ll look at <em>Reinforcement Learning</em>.</p>

<h3>MDPs</h3>

<p>We have states, actions, and a state transition matrix where
<code>T(s,a,s') = P(s'|a,s)</code>. A reward function R(s) defines the goal to
achieve. For now, the rewards are simply attached to states. The
problem is then to attach an action to each state so that R(s) is
maximized.</p>

<p>A <em>policy</em> assigns actions to any state (except absorbing states).</p>

<p>In a stochastic environment, what&rsquo;s the problem with the tree approach
of conventional planning? Large branching factor, deep trees, many
states visited more than once.</p>
