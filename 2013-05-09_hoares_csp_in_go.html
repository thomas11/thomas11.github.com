<div class="abstract">
  
    <span class="date">May 9, 2013</span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; 
  
  <span itemprop="description">Tony Hoare&#39;s &#34;Communicating sequential processes&#34; is not only a very influential Computer Science paper, but it was also a main inspiration for Go. It is full of examples written in a pseudo-code designed for the paper. I translated all these examples to Go, with unit tests.</span>

<div class="article" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p><a href="https://github.com/thomas11/csp">The code is on github</a> as usual. I
documented it pretty extensively, and you can
<a href="http://godoc.org/github.com/thomas11/csp">read the documentation</a>
nicely formatted on godoc.org, so there&rsquo;s not much left to say here.</p>

<p>The point of this exercise was not to produce something usable in
production code, but to fully understand Hoare&rsquo;s paper. It&rsquo;s easy to
convince yourself you understood something after reading it, but only
doing or teaching makes you fully grasp it. It was an enlightening
experience, and it&rsquo;s impressive to see how far ahead of his time Hoare
was when writing this. Concurrency became a big topic outside of
academia only in the last few years.</p>

<p>This little project was submitted to
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5512600">Hacker News</a> and
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1bv65p/the_examples_from_tony_hoares_seminal_1978_paper/">Reddit</a>
(not by me) and attracted some good comments.</p>
