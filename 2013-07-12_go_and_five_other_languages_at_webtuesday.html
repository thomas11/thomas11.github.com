<div class="article" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>This past June, fellow Zurich hacker <a href="http://ivanjovanovic.com/">Ivan</a>
organized a cool <a href="http://www.webtuesday.ch">WebTuesday</a>:
<a href="http://webtuesday.ch/meetings/20130611/">seven languages in seven minutes each</a>.
We ended up with six languages due to a last-minute cancellation, but
that doesn&rsquo;t detract from the idea: exposing people to different
programming paradigms, styles, and tool chains in rapid succession to
expand their horizons and to foster discussion. I think it worked out
very well.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="http://webtuesday.ch/meetings/20130611/">the announcement</a>
for the speaker list and the full program.</p>

<p>All the presentations were great. Thanks to the speakers who put in the
effort to make them fun!</p>

<p>For my Go presentation, I made a
<a href="/static/posts/2013-07-12_go_and_five_other_languages_at_webtuesday/slides/go-seven-minutes.html">few simple slides</a>.
The vintage boxer pic refers to Ivan&rsquo;s characterization of Go that I
can agree with: somewhat old-fashioned but packing a good punch.</p>

<p>The structure of my presentation is simple. After exposing the
audience to the syntax with a Hello World, I address concurrency
through goroutines, channels, and select. Then I give some quick
examples of how Go makes program design easy with its clever types,
interfaces and embedded structs.</p>

<p>I think people liked it and I had some good conversations afterwards.
The interest in Go as well as other lesser-known languages has
definitely developed in the Zurich tech scene, and I think we&rsquo;ll see
interesting stuff in the months to come.</p>
