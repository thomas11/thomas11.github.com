<h1 itemprop="headline">GDG DevFest Zurich with an intro to Go</h1>

    <span class="date">Dec 10, 2012</span>&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; 
  
  <span itemprop="description">The Google Developers Group Zurich organized a great weekend of talks, hacking and networking in October. Unexpectedly, I got to present Go in an hour-long hands-on tutorial.</span>
  
</div>

<div class="article" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>Before October, I had never made it to a
<a href="http://www.gdgzh.ch/">GDG Zurich</a> event, but the
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdgdevfestzurich/">DevFest 2012</a> they
announced sounded too interesting to pass it up. I don&rsquo;t want to bore
you with the minutiae of how it went down, so let me just say it was a
great and very well organized weekend. By my rough guess about 100
hackers showed up, which I found quite impressive. After casual
introductions and drinks on Friday night we spent Saturday and Sunday
in the Zurich youth hostel for talks and hacking. Big thanks to the
organizers Vadim, Michel, Corsin and Robert (see
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdgdevfestzurich/home/orga">here</a>), you
did a great job.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the presentations about AppEngine by Jerome Mouton
and about the new Google Drive SDK by Nicolas Garnier. Would love to
play with these at some point.</p>

<p>The rest of Saturday was spent chatting and getting to know people,
until at some point I mentioned working with <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>
at <a href="http://nhumi.com/">Nhumi</a> and people got very interested. Almost
everyone had read about it, but no one had used it. There happened to
be a free slot left for a codelab on Sunday morning, so I soon found
myself with a job to do.</p>

<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t have much time I just roughly followed the
<a href="http://tour.golang.org/">Tour of Go</a>, skipping ahead a little
sometimes. This was a good decision as the Go devs have put a lot of
thought into its structure. In addition, I made just six
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZOgBTvAoveph4NneI05dV20qn7YUbQeioaEP0D8_4uU/edit?usp=sharing">slides summarizing some Go essentials from my point of view</a>.
This was my &ldquo;main points about Go&rdquo; slide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fun and productive</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>Different &ldquo;OO&rdquo;: embedded structs, methods</li>
<li>Concurrency</li>
</ul>

<p>I gave a code example for each of the latter three points. The
audience of about 20 seemed to follow along easily and there were
plenty of questions. It was neat to respond to questions and remarks
directly by demonstrating things live in the
<a href="http://play.golang.org/">Go Playground</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for coming, and have fun with Go!</p>
