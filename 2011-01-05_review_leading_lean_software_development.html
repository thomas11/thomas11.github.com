<div class="article" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>A book on software development with the subtitle <em>Results are not the
point</em>? Is that just attention-grabbing provocation or are the authors
on to something?</p>

<p>This is one of the first books on the management and organization of
software development that I read, so take the following notes with a
grain salt due to my lack of perspective.</p>

<p>The Poppendiecks have been consulting on applying lean principles to
software development for years, and they have written on it before in
<em>Lean Software Development</em> and <em>Implementing Lean Software
Development</em> (see <a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/">their website</a>).  The
&ldquo;Leading &hellip;&rdquo; book builds on these two.  A colleague recommended and
lent this book to me, so I read it out of order.  That, and the fact
that I&rsquo;m not familiar with the whole &ldquo;lean&rdquo; concept beyond some
rudimentary basics, made the book somewhat difficult to digest.  Each
chapter made sense to me, but my brain is still struggling to assemble
the content into a coherent whole.</p>

<p>Lacking the foundations of Lean, I had to look at the book at a
generic guide on best practices in management, organization, and
communication. Maybe that&rsquo;s not a bad way of approaching such a book.
Its structure certainly makes sense from that point of view.  Six
chapters address major factors in successful product design and
delivery: Systems Thinking, Technical Excellence, Reliable Delivery,
Relentless Improvement, Great People, Aligned Leaders.</p>

<p>In the introduction, the authors note that since everyone sees the
world through a particular &ldquo;frame&rdquo;, different people and thus
organizations might see their surroundings in vastly different ways.
This limits the questions you ask and the alternatives you consider.
When things don&rsquo;t work out, your frame of reference may have been off.
Building on this observation, the book&rsquo;s chapters are composed of
frames, that is different views on the development process.
Real-world examples introduce and connect the frames.  This structure
allows the authors to focus on individual aspects of success while
keeping the full range of software projects in view.</p>

<p>With 24 frames, the book packs a surprising amount of content into 250
pages. Fully summarizing it would be time-consuming and pointless--the
book itself is readable and without filler content. Nevertheless, a
few chapters or frames stood out for me.</p>

<p>In Technical Excellence, the authors make a strong point for
emphasizing quality, for instance through test-driven development and
evolutionary iterations, and excellence, through valuing expertise
and avoiding the senseless &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; of the best developers to
managers. These points are not new to developers, but it&rsquo;s great to
see them put forth so strongly in a management book.</p>

<p>Aligned Leaders contains several nuggets of insight into teams and
leadership that I found fascinating.  I&rsquo;ve never lead a team larger
than two part-time programmers, so I&rsquo;m sure someone with experience
would read these chapters through a different frame.  The authors
state that knowledge workers must necessarily be independent and
self-directed; if their job doesn&rsquo;t allow that, they cannot do their
best work.  Therefore, the role of a manager can only be to set the
tone and to otherwise focus on <em>making people better</em>--through caring,
respect, and coaching.</p>

<p>Overall, the book impressed me with its combination of insightful
content, clear and natural writing, and constant referral to
real-world examples.  You might want to start with the authors&rsquo;
introductory <em>Lean Software Development</em>, though, to better understand
the underlying ideas.</p>
