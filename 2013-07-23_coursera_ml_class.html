</div>

<div class="article" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>Machine Learning is on my radar of things to learn since a long time.
After all, I&rsquo;m already kind of a data guy in software development, but
I&rsquo;m not very strong on the analysis and classification side.</p>

<p>Professor
<a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/">Andrew Ng of the Stanford AI lab</a>
offers a
<a href="https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/class/index">Coursera class in Machine Learning</a>.
I took the recent class from April to June 2013.</p>

<p>The class was a great experience. I found the lectures to be clear and
the content made perfect sense as an intro to machine learning. The
pace was often a bit slow for my taste, since I already knew the
required math, but this was easily fixed by watching the lectures at a
higher speed. The Coursera online video player offers this convenient
feature including resampling so the voice doesn&rsquo;t sound funny.</p>

<p>This was the syllabus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linear Regression with One Variable</li>
<li>Linear Regression with Multiple Variables</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>Regularization</li>
<li>Neural Networks: Representation</li>
<li>Neural Networks: Learning</li>
<li>Advice for Applying Machine Learning</li>
<li>Machine Learning System Design</li>
<li>Support Vector Machines (SVMs)</li>
<li>Clustering</li>
<li>Dimensionality Reduction</li>
<li>Anomaly Detection</li>
<li>Recommender Systems</li>
<li>Large-Scale Machine Learning</li>
<li>Example of an application of machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>Each lecture had a homework assignment to go with it, where we
implemented the algorithms in Octave. This was crucial to properly
understand them, and to remember at least the gist of everything. It&rsquo;s
too easy to zone out when watching a lecture and to convince yourself
afterward that you got it. In addition, I had never used Octave (or
Matlab) before and I now realize how useful it is for quick
development of mathematical code.</p>

<p>Below are some of my class notes. They are neither complete nor
formatted well or checked for correctness, so youâ€™d be better off
taking the class yourself! The last two lectures are missing because I
had too much other things going on.</p>

<hr />

<p>Really nice intro lectures with lots of motivation and an accessible
explanation of supervised vs. unsupervised learning.</p>

<h3>Notation</h3>

<pre><code>m := number of training examples
x's := input variables
y's := output variables
h := hypothesis := learning algorithm. h(x) = y.
</code></pre>

<h3>Linear regression with one variable</h3>

<p><code>h(x) = t0 + t1*x</code> &mdash; univariate linear regression, straight line.</p>

<p>Fitting h is a minimization problem over the sum of all x&rsquo;s. For each
x, minimize the square of the difference between y and h(x). We divide
that sum by 2m to average. This cost function is called square error
and is written J(t0, t1).</p>

<p><em>Gradient descent</em> solves linear regression. Repeat until convergence:</p>

<pre><code>t_j := t_j - alpha( (delta/delta*t_j) * J(t0, t1) )
</code></pre>

<p>Alpha is a learning rate. t0 and t1 must be updated simultaneously,
assigning to temp variables.</p>

<p><em>Batch gradient descent</em> means we look at all training examples for
each step.</p>

<h3>Linear regression with more than one variable</h3>

<p>Generalized gradient descent: <code>h(x) = theta' * x = t0x0 + t1x1 + ...</code>.
We set x0 to 1 always. The parameters t0, t1, &hellip; form a vector theta.</p>

<p>The cost function is then <code>J(theta) = 1/2m * sum_m( (h(x_i)-y_i)^2 )</code>.</p>

<p>The update step is <code>t_j = t_j - alpha * der(t_j) * J(theta)</code>.</p>

<p>Scaling gradient descent to make it converge much faster: scale the
x_i by doing <code>(x_i - avg(x))/range(x)</code> where range is max - min.</p>

<p>If gradient descent runs correctly, J(theta), the cost function,
should decrease after every step. If it&rsquo;s increasing or oscillating
it&rsquo;s usually a too large alpha. Plotting the cost function over the
number of iterations helps debugging.</p>

<p>Ng recommends starting with 0.001 and increasing threefold to 0.003,
0.01 and so on.</p>

<h3>Solving linear regression with the normal equation</h3>

<p>Solving theta analytically. Construct a matrix X (<em>design matrix</em>)
that is the table of feature values in the training data, with the
columns being x0 (=1), x1, etc. X is an m x (n+1) matrix (n for n
features, +1 for x0). Correspondingly, take y to be the vector of
targets in the training data.</p>

<p>Theta is then <code>(X' X)^-1 X' y</code>. In Octave: <code>pinv(X'*X) * X' * y</code>.</p>

<h3>Classification with logistic regression</h3>

<p>Result variable y of {0, 1}, <em>negative class</em> and <em>positive class</em>.</p>

<p>Linear regression could be used by setting a threshold for the
classifier h_theta. But outliers will greatly influence the
classifier.</p>

<p>In logistic regression (which is actually a classification algorithm),
the prediction h_theta is always between 0 and 1. We call it
hypothesis and interpret it as the probability that y=1 on input x:
<code>h_theta(x) = P(y=1 | x; theta)</code>.</p>

<p>Where in linear regression h_theta(x) was <code>theta'*x</code>, it is now
<code>g(theta'*x)</code>. g is called the <em>sigmoid function</em> or <em>logistic
function</em> and is defined as <code>g(z) = 1 / 1+e^-z</code>. It asymptotes at 0 on
the left and 1 at the right and is 0.5 at zero.</p>

<p>We predict the hypothesis to be true when g(z) &gt;= 0.5, which happens
when z &gt;= 0, where z is theta&rsquo;*x.</p>

<p>The <em>decision boundary</em> is the line drawn by <code>theta'*x &gt;= 0</code>. It is a
property of the hypothesis, not of the data set, so we need to fit the
parameters to the training set.</p>

<p>For non-linear decision boundaries, we can introduce polynomial
features such as x2^2 (and possibly delete the linear ones by setting
their parameter in theta to 0). For example, <code>x1^2 + x2^2 = 1</code> is a
circle of radius 1.</p>

<p>The cost function we used for linear regression, half of the squared
error, is not convex when used with logistic regression. That means
gradient descent will get stuck in local minima. Instead, we use the
convex function <code>Cost(h_theta(x), y) = -log(h_theta(x)) if y=1,
-log(1-h_theta(x)) if y=0</code>. This is equivalent to <code>-y*log(h(x)) -
(1-y)*log(1-h(x))</code>.</p>

<p>The overall cost J(theta) is then <code>1/m sum_i_m Cost(h_theta(x_i),
y_i)</code>. It can be derived statistically through maximum likelihood
estimation.</p>

<p>For gradient descent, we take the derivative of J as usual, ending up
with <code>theta_j = theta_j - alpha * sum_i_m((h(x_i) - y_i) * xj_i)</code>.
This is identical to linear regression!</p>

<p>Feature scaling applies to logistic regression just as it does to
linear regression.</p>

<h3>More sophisticated algorithms than gradient descent</h3>

<ul>
<li>conjugate gradient</li>
<li>BFGS</li>
<li>L-BFGS</li>
</ul>

<p>They figure out the learning rate on their own and converge faster,
but are more complex.</p>

<p>In Octave xthere&rsquo;s <code>fminunc</code>&mdash;function minimization unconstrained.</p>

<h3>Regularization</h3>

<p>Underfitting = high bias. Polynomial of too low degree in logistic
regression.</p>

<p>Overfitting = high variance. Polynomial of too high degree in logistic
regression. Happens with too many features.</p>

<p>When we have a lot of features, plotting the classifier is impossible
and it becomes hard to detect overfitting. Later we&rsquo;ll see <em>model
selection</em> to decide which features to discard.</p>

<p>Discarding features loses information. Instead, we can employ
<em>regularization</em>. The idea is to penalize the features (thetas):
multiply them with a big factor in the cost function forces the
minimization to make them really small. J(theta) becomes <code>1/2m
sum_i_m(h(xi)-yi)^2 + lambda sum_j_n(theta_j^2)</code>. Lambda is the
regularization factor. The derivative of the added lambda term used in
the update step is <code>lambda/m * theta_j</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t depend on the i in
the sum, so it can be pulled out.</p>

<p>Using the normal equation, lambda is simply applied to the feature
matrix.</p>

<h2>Neural networks</h2>

<p>Logistic regression blows up with lots of features. There are about
O(nÂ²) terms if we include only the second-order terms x1x2, x1x3 etc.,
and O(nÂ³) terms if we include the cubic terms.</p>

<p>Some terminology:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>neuron</em> or <em>bias unit</em></li>
<li>input wires x1, &hellip;, xn, plus x0 = 1.</li>
<li>output is h_theta(x) = 1 / (1+e^(-theta&rsquo;<em>x)), the sigmoid function,
here *activation function</em>.</li>
<li>theta are the parameters or <em>weights</em></li>
<li>input layer, hidden layers (neither x nor y), output layers</li>
</ul>

<p>Theta is a matrix since the neural network has a matrix structure (one
column per layer). If layer j has sj units, and layer k has sk
units, then theta_j is of dimension sk x sj+1. For example, with
j=k=2, <code>activation(i, k) = g(theta(i,0)*x0 + theta(i,1)*x1 +
theta(i,2)*x2)</code>.</p>

<p>Neural networks are basically several layers of logistic regression.
It learns the features from the basic input features x1, x2, &hellip;.</p>

<p>The layers, their size etc. are called the architecture of a neural
network.</p>

<p>To learn theta, we first need a cost function. The cost function is a
generalization of the one for logistic regression. For K output units,
we compute h_theta(x) for k = 1,&hellip;,K. We&rsquo;re taking the kth output
unit and compare it to y_k.</p>

<p>Back propagation: let delta_j_l be the error of node j in layer l. For
the output layer L, <code>delta_L = a_L - y</code> (vectorized for all nodes in
the layer). For the previous layers l, <code>delta_l = (Theta_l' *
delta_l+1) .* g'(z_l)</code>. The derivative of the sigmoid at z_l is <code>a_l
.* (1-a_l)</code>. There is no delta_1 since this is the input. We start at
L and go back to 2.</p>

<p>The back propagation algorithm is then: for each training example (xi,
yi) do</p>

<ol>
<li>Set a1 = xi</li>
<li>Perform forward propagation to compute a_l for l = 2,&hellip;,L.</li>
<li>Compute the error delta_L = a_L - y_i.</li>
<li>Compute delta_(L-1), &hellip;, delta_2. <code>DELTA_ij_l = DELTA_ij_l +
 a_j_l*delta_i_(l+1)</code>. The latter expression is vectorized as
 <code>DELTA_l = DELTA_l + delta_(l+1)*a_l'</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, <code>DELTA/m</code> is the partial derivative of the cost function.</p>

<h2>Machine Learning Diagnostics</h2>

<p>Your ML approach isn&rsquo;t working so well. What&rsquo;s wrong?</p>

<p>Split data into training and test set, approx. 70 to 30. After
learning, calculate the average square error on the test set (linear
regression).</p>

<p>To choose between different models, such as different order
polynomials for regression, we can learn using each candidate model on
the training set and choose the one performing best on the test set.
However, our error will now be optimistic because we picked the best
model for the test set. To avoid this, we use a third data set for
cross-validation. We test the model hypotheses on the validation set
and then estimate the generalization error using the test set.</p>

<p>If performance is not good enough, we need to distinguish between
underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance). In case of a
bias problem, both the training and the cross-validation error are
high. In case of high variance, the training error is low (because the
training set fits very well), but the cv error is high.</p>

<p>Large learning parameters (lambda) will lead to high bias (underfit),
small ones to high variance.</p>

<h2>How to approach an ML problem</h2>

<ol>
<li>Partition the data into training, test, cv.</li>
<li>Start with a simple algorithm and validate it.</li>
<li>Plot learning curves (comparing average squared error of test and
cv set) to see whether there is high variance or high bias and
therefore whether more examples, more features etc. are going to
help.</li>
<li>Error analysis: manually examine the erroneous examples in the cv
set to spot any systematic errors.</li>
</ol>
