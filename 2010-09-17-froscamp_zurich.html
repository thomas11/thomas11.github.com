</div>

<div class="article" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"><p>So, another one of those belated meeting/event reports: on 2010-09-17,
I was in Zurich for the first-ever
<a href="http://wiki.froscamp.org/Welcome">FrOSCamp</a>. It was an Open
Source/Free Software event with an exhibition floor, talks, and &ldquo;a
fancy party with creative commons licensed beer and music&rdquo;&mdash;what&rsquo;s
not to like!</p>

<p>I presented my &ldquo;Praktisches RDF in Perl&rdquo; talk that I recycled from the
<a href="https://jugglingbits.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/semantic-hacking-rdf-in-perl-presentation/">German Perl Workshop</a>,
to spread the word some more. This time, I had prepared an English
version, but as I only had German speakers in the audience, I
presented in German.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my presentation only drew a handful of people this
time. Note to self: work on the abstract some more. I had suspected
that my FrOSCamp one was wordy and not catchy, but didn&rsquo;t get around
to rewriting it. At least the audience were pretty engaged and asked
lots of questions, which I prefer to a larger crowd that&rsquo;s half
asleep.</p>

<p>The presentation was recorded and is now
<a href="http://www.multimedia.ethz.ch/conferences/2010/froscamp/?doi=10.3930/ETHZ/AV-13ff192d-43b9-4628-9ff4-6e4f69f2e01f">online as slides+audio</a>. This
was a first for me. I could forget about it while presenting, but I
was pretty nervous listening to it for the first time, not sure what
mess of incoherent rambling and half-finished sentences to
expect. Fortunately, I found it ok in the end. Of course, I found
several things to improve, but I guess that&rsquo;s expected for someone who
doesn&rsquo;t present often and is just getting started. My list of the main
points to improve is:</p>

<ul>
<li>The introduction should be much shorter and more focussed. A bit
like a sales pitch, not as in being obnoxious and fake, but as in
focussed on getting the audience&rsquo;s attention and appreciation for
the topic.</li>
<li>Too many sentences didn&rsquo;t flow properly. Simply doing one or two
more dry runs should fix that.</li>
<li>Have some more visualizations such as diagrams on the slides.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, I was pleased with a few things about my
presentation: the style of having little text on the slides and more
verbal explanation worked well, the code samples seemed to be the
right size to digest during a talk, and the questions at the end
showed that people had gotten the key points.</p>

<p>Before my presentation, I got to see
<a href="http://www.renee-baecker.de/">Renee Baecker</a>&rsquo;s talk about
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Critic">Perl::Critic</a>. I&rsquo;m using
it on my code and thus knew the basics, but I appreciated the advanced
example towards the end, where Renee walked us through writing our own
critic rules. This works via
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PPI">PPI</a>, so you can find patterns in
the AST that match the constructs you want to check. I also found it
interesting to hear Renee&rsquo;s personal experience with the severity
levels: he&rsquo;s typically on 3, sometimes 2, but 1 is too harsh.</p>

<p>Other than that, I was mainly hanging out at the Perl booth, a first
for me! The booth was staffed by Renee and Roman from Winterthur (CH),
two really nice guys whom I had a great time with, discussing
everything from Perl modules to freelancing.</p>

<p>BTW, remember the blurb from the FrOSCamp website I quoted at the top
about creative commons licensed beer?
<a href="http://www.freebeer.ch/">That wasn&rsquo;t a joke</a>. FreeBeer is an organic
beer, produced by an independent brewery near Zurich, and the recipe
is online under a CC license. And it tastes great! A cloudy, full
blonde just how I like it :-)</p>
